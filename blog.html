                               Make a note to yourself in your calendar, phone or notebook of when you complete each assignment or make time to study. Do it a day before so that you don’t stress the day of. If know you have somewhere to go or something to do that week, make sure it doesn’t interfere with your study time. Schedule your study time around the event. Never skip it. It will make you lose track.</p>
          <p>Wasting time is addictive. Don’t put off tasks until the last minute. Don’t make decisions for temporary pleasure that will have future consequences. Have a checklist so that it helps you accomplish all the things you need and also to make sure that you don’t forget to complete them.</p>
          <p>Make friends that encourage you and help you move forward toward your goals. Avoid negativity. It’ll drain you and keep you stuck. I have had friends in my first semester who would always find fault in what I did and made me feel like there was something wrong in each of my projects.</p>

           	           <p class="quote">Don’t compare yourself with others. Don’t do things because others do it. There may be expectations set for you by your parents, society, and peers but more than that, God has a unique plan for you. Live out the purpose set for you by God.</p>
           	           <p>In this young age, sometimes we crave attention from people just for a little satisfaction. We might need people to treat as good as we are or as good as we want them to be and that doesn't always work out.</p>
           	           <p>Enjoy each moment because it’s all over before you know it.  4 years might feel like a lifetime when you first start college but before you know it, you'll be walking off that stage with a degree in hand.</p>
